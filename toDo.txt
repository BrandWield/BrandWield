Can do:
- Save browser image uploads for image files to public 'google cloud storage' links (to save to firebase as the image variables)
- display color code (in an actual color display) on load, and on change
- Create templates in Bannerbear for social media banners
- 'clear' buttons
        - stops working from 'brand' section down
        - does not work with images & fonts

Solve:
- Figure out how to 'write' or 'set' data to firebase upon the 'lock' button being pressed.
- Create identical preview-posts for the 4 social media platforms in the 'newContent' page.
- Show where variable is changed in the users brand content from the 'myBrand' page (where they edit the variables)
- Add a 'click-to-add' function to addable myBrand variables like 'people', 'offerings', 'locations', etc.fire
- Firebase hosting to live url
        - Set up user accounts with firebase auth and allow account-specific functions
- Import instagram api profile url pic to the image placeholder
